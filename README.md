# Angular Testing Example

This example combines a very simple angular app with jasmine and karma to
provide a starting point for an angular app with unit testing and coverage reports.

## Install Dependencies
1. If you have not already, install nodejs and npm.  A quick google search for this on your platform of choice should provide adequate instruction.

2. In this directory, install dependencies:
```
npm install karma
npm install karma-jasmine
npm install jasmine
npm install angular
npm install angular-mocks
```

3. Install the Chrome web browser if you do not have it already.

## Run Tests
### Linux
```
karma start &
karam run
```
### Windoze
```
karma start

```
then in a new dos command shell in the same directory:
```
karma run
```
